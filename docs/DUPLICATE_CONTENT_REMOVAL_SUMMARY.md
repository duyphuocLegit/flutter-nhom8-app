# Duplicate Content Removal Summary

## Issue Identified

The settings page contained duplicate content with the menu page:

### Menu Page Content:

- **Contact Us** → `ContactUsScreen()`
- **About Us** → `AboutUsScreen()`
- **Help** → `HelpScreen()`

### Settings Page Duplicates:

- **App Version** → App info dialog (overlaps with "About Us")
- **Help & Support** → Help support dialog (overlaps with "Help")

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced About Card

- **Removed**: `_buildAboutCard()` with 3 items:

  - App Version (now handled by About Us in menu)
  - Help & Support (now handled by Help in menu)
  - Reset Settings (moved to App Management)

- **Added**: `_buildAppManagementCard()` with focused settings-specific content:
  - Reset Settings (settings-specific functionality)

### 2. Removed Duplicate Methods and Dialogs

- **Removed Methods**:

  - `_showAppInfo()`
  - `_showHelpSupport()`

- **Removed Dialog Classes**:
  - `_AppInfoDialog` (148 lines)
  - `_HelpSupportDialog` (174 lines)

### 3. Navigation Flow Clarification

- **Menu Page**: Primary navigation for informational content

  - Contact Us → Dedicated contact screen
  - About Us → Dedicated about screen
  - Help → Dedicated help screen

- **Settings Page**: Focused on app configuration and management
  - App Management → Settings-specific actions (Reset Settings)
  - All other cards remain settings-focused
