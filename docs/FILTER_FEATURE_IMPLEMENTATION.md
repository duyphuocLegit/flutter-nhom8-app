# Filter Feature Implementation

## Overview

The filter feature has been successfully implemented for the TaskApp homepage. Users can now filter their tasks based on multiple criteria to better organize and manage their workload.

## Features

### Filter Categories

1. **Status Filter**

   - All Tasks
   - Pending Tasks
   - Completed Tasks

2. **Priority Filter**

   - All Priorities
   - High Priority (Red indicator)
   - Medium Priority (Orange indicator)
   - Low Priority (Green indicator)

3. **Due Date Filter**

   - All Dates
   - Due Today
   - This Week
   - Overdue (Red indicator for urgent tasks)

4. **Category Filter**
   - All Categories
   - Work
   - Personal
   - Shopping
   - Health
   - Education

### UI Components

#### Filter Button

- Located in the "Your Tasks" header section
- Shows a visual indicator (blue dot) when filters are active
- Button background changes color when filters are applied
- Tapping opens the filter bottom sheet

#### Filter Bottom Sheet

- Modern, sleek design with rounded corners and shadows
- Clear visual hierarchy with section titles
- Chip-based selection with icons and color coding
- "Clear All" option to reset filters
- "Apply Filters" button to confirm selections

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified/Created

1. **lib/widgets/filter_bottom_sheet.dart** (New)

   - Complete filter UI implementation
   - Handles filter state management
   - Provides callback for filter changes

2. **lib/widgets/tasks.dart** (Modified)

   - Added filter parameter support
   - Implemented `_applyFilters()` method

   - Enhanced empty state handling

3. **lib/screens/home.dart** (Modified)
   - Added filter state management
   - Integrated filter bottom sheet
   - Added visual filter indicators
   - Updated page reconstruction with filters

#### Filter Logic

The filtering system uses multiple criteria simultaneously:

- **Status filtering**: Separates completed vs pending tasks
- **Priority filtering**: Filters by task importance level
- **Date filtering**: Handles relative date ranges (today, week, overdue)
- **Category filtering**: Groups tasks by user-defined categories

#### State Management

- Filters are managed at the HomePage level
- State is passed down to TaskWidget component
- Real-time updates when filters change
- Preserves filter state during navigation

### User Experience

- **Intuitive Interface**: Familiar chip-based selection
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for active filters
- **Responsive Design**: Smooth animations and transitions
- **Easy Reset**: One-tap clear all functionality
- **Smart Empty States**: Different messages for no tasks vs no filtered results

### Performance Considerations

- Efficient filtering using native Dart list operations
- Minimal rebuilds with proper state management
- Filtered results cached until task changes
- Responsive UI with proper loading states

## Usage Instructions

1. **Opening Filters**: Tap the "Filter" button in the homepage header
2. **Selecting Filters**: Tap on any filter chip to select/deselect
3. **Multiple Filters**: Combine multiple criteria for precise filtering

## Future Enhancements
